            When you upload a PDF to our educational app, the app uses advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing) and machine learning algorithms, powered by OpenAI, to extract key information from the text and images in the PDF. This information is then transformed into interactive learning cards that make up a comprehensive study set.<br>
             <br>The learning cards utilize spaced repetition, a technique proven to increase memory retention and make learning more efficient, to help users retain the information they learn. Users can interact with the learning cards in a variety of ways, such as reading, listening to audio, and answering questions.  <br>
             <br> By uploading your own PDFs, you can personalize your learning experience and study topics that are specific to your needs and interests. This feature allows you to learn at your own pace and on your own schedule, making education more flexible and convenient than ever before. <br>
